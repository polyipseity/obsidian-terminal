Restore focus to previous non-terminal pane when unfocusing terminal.

When using the toggle focus hotkey or unfocus command, focus now returns to the last active non-terminal pane (e.g., your note) instead of just blurring the terminal. This improves the workflow when using the terminal in a side panel. ([GH#85](https://github.com/polyipseity/obsidian-terminal/pull/85) by [@Mendi23](https://github.com/Mendi23))
