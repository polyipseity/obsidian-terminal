"obsidian-terminal": patch

Widen modals to ensure they are usable on all themes:
- Apply inline width to Profiles list, Profile, and Terminal Options modals
- Inline styles guarantee `80vw` width with `900px` max and `600px` min

This makes the Profile editor and list modals significantly wider regardless of theme CSS.
