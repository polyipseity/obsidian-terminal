Clean up profile management list UI and add preset selection modal

Replaced the "Prepend" and "Append" dropdowns in the Profile Management modal with a single "+" button at the top for a cleaner look. The new button opens a selection list (Suggest Modal) for choosing profile presets. Improved the visual alignment of action buttons and fixed a bug where newly added profiles were not immediately reflected in the modal view.
