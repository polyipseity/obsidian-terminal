# Release Workflow: Rolling Tag Build
#
# This workflow builds and publishes a rolling release when the `rolling` tag is pushed.
# It uses the `ubuntu-slim` runner to reduce GitHub Actions billing costs while maintaining compatibility.
#
# Rationale: `ubuntu-slim` is chosen for its smaller image size, which speeds up job startup and reduces CI minutes billed.
# This is especially important for open source projects with limited CI budgets.
#
# Jobs and steps are named for clarity in the Actions UI.

# Ensure only one instance of this workflow runs at any time across the repository.
# - Use the workflow identifier (`github.workflow`) so the group is unique per workflow
#   across the repository and does not require hardcoding.
# - `cancel-in-progress: true` cancels any currently running instance so the newest
#   run replaces older ones and always runs (useful for rolling releases).
