# Release Workflow: Rolling Tag Build
#
# This workflow builds and publishes a rolling release when the `rolling` tag is pushed.
# It uses the `ubuntu-slim` runner to reduce GitHub Actions billing costs while maintaining compatibility.
#
# Rationale: `ubuntu-slim` is chosen for its smaller image size, which speeds up job startup and reduces CI minutes billed.
# This is especially important for open source projects with limited CI budgets.
#
# Jobs and steps are named for clarity in the Actions UI.
