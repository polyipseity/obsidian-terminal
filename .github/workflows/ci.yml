# CI Workflow: Build & Test (pnpm & npm)
#
# This workflow runs build and test jobs for both pnpm and npm package managers.
# It uses the `ubuntu-slim` runner to reduce GitHub Actions billing costs while maintaining compatibility.
#
# Rationale: `ubuntu-slim` is chosen for its smaller image size, which speeds up job startup and reduces CI minutes billed.
# This is especially important for open source projects with limited CI budgets.
#
# Jobs are named for clarity in the Actions UI. Each step is named for traceability.
