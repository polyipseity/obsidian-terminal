# CI Workflow: Build & Test (pnpm & npm)
#
# This workflow runs build and test jobs for both pnpm and npm package managers.
#
# Jobs are named for clarity in the Actions UI. Each step is named for traceability.

# Use concurrency to deduplicate runs.
# - For pull requests: group by `pr-<number>` so multiple commits to the same PR
#   cancel previous runs and only the latest is kept.
# - For direct pushes: fall back to deduplicating by commit SHA so identical
#   commits don't trigger multiple concurrent workflows.
# - Include the `github.workflow` name in the group to avoid cross-workflow collisions.
