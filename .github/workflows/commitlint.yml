# Commit Message Lint Workflow
#
# This workflow lints commit messages on push, pull request, or manual dispatch.
#
# Rationale for using `ubuntu-latest` instead of `ubuntu-slim`:
# - The `wagoid/commitlint-github-action` uses a Docker action image for linting.
# - The `ubuntu-slim` runner does not include Docker, so it cannot pull and run Docker-based actions.
# - Therefore, `ubuntu-latest` is required to ensure Docker is available and the action works correctly.
