# Commit Message Lint Workflow
#
# This workflow lints commit messages on push, pull request, or manual dispatch.
#
# Rationale for using `ubuntu-latest` instead of `ubuntu-slim`:
# - The `wagoid/commitlint-github-action` uses a Docker action image for linting.
# - The `ubuntu-slim` runner does not include Docker, so it cannot pull and run Docker-based actions.
# - Therefore, `ubuntu-latest` is required to ensure Docker is available and the action works correctly.

      - "**" # Ignore tag pushes
  workflow_dispatch:

# Use concurrency to deduplicate runs.
# - For pull requests: group by `pr-<number>` so multiple commits to the same PR
#   cancel previous runs and only the latest is kept.
# - For direct pushes: fall back to deduplicating by commit SHA so identical
#   commits don't trigger multiple concurrent workflows.
# - Include the `github.workflow` name in the group to avoid cross-workflow collisions.
