# Commit Message Lint Workflow
#
# This workflow lints commit messages on push, pull request, or manual dispatch.
#
# Rationale for using `ubuntu-latest` instead of `ubuntu-slim`:
# - The `wagoid/commitlint-github-action` uses a Docker action image for linting.
# - The `ubuntu-slim` runner does not include Docker, so it cannot pull and run Docker-based actions.
# - Therefore, `ubuntu-latest` is required to ensure Docker is available and the action works correctly.
#
# For more details, see: https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/6775

    # - pull_request: skip if github.event.pull_request.commits == 0
    # - workflow_dispatch: skip by default (no commit context)
